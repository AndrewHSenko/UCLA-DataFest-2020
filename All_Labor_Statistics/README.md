NOTE
Due to the size of the some of the files, I have utilized Git LFS. These files include raw_data.txt, Results.csv, and Results_with_Words.txt. To retrieve them, use "git lfs pull". In due time, I will zip these files for easier retrieval...

Labor_Statistics_Classifications.txt
Contains all classification codes for each series entry
Notes:
	-Same file as ln.series.txt but renamed for clarity
	
raw_data.txt:
Contains the raw labor statistics from bls.gov

All_Categories_Classifications.txt:
Contains all classification titles for each code found in the data set
Notes:
	-There are empty lines in the All_Categories_Classifications.txt due to some entires being empty series_ids from the series file.
